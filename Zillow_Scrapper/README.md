# Housing Data 

A lot of this data needs to be cleaned. I got historical data from 2010 to now but alot of houses 
are newer than 2010 so they don't have that data. I got about 850 houses on the market 
currently from Denver. The data frame has an attribute with the neighborhood so we should
group them by that and by year to get an idea of what is going on.

I would recommend that you use data in CLEANER_DATA folder. "data.csv" is the one with historical data


# PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH DATA IN "ORIGINAL_DATA_NO_TOUCH"
Those are originals from initial web scrapping that took 4 hours to get because I 
had to do it slowly to avoid the CAPTCHA robot stuff. Those should serve as backups.
